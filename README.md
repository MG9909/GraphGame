Game main of graph

My first game created via WPF C#

Game rules:
> Two players (different by color)
> The move is made step by step, started with red player
> In order to make your move its enough to click on empty circle or opposite color
> A line is drawn between the nearest points of the same
> You can capture opponent points
> If the new vertex of the graph contains at least 3 edges, you damage the enemy.
> Damage is calculated from the number of edges of the new vertex (at least 3)
> Player who first takes 100 hp from an opponent wins
